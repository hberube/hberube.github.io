# Leaders Page Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made:
1. ✅ Removed "Équipes" button from navigation (desktop & mobile)
2. ✅ Added team data loading to leaders component
3. ✅ Added expansion functionality to leaders component
4. ✅ Added MatExpansionModule import

## What's Working:
- Leaders page shows team cards
- Navigation reduced to just "Meneurs" and "Stats"
- Component has access to full team data

## Next Step Needed:
Update the leaders template to:
1. Make each team card clickable
2. Show player roster when clicked (forwards, defensemen, goalies)
3. Add expand/collapse icon
4. Style the expanded content

The infrastructure is in place. The template just needs to be updated to show the expandable player content when a team card is clicked.

Would you like me to proceed with updating the template to show players when you click on a team card?
